Blind Actor
===================

This is part of a bespoke project that controls my home. Specifically, this device controls a set of motorised blinds. 

The hardware also has the capability to detect changes in weight on two pads, the idea being to detect bed occupancy.

Check the `Hardware Schematic` folder for details about hardware.

![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dermotos/blind-actor/master/Hardware%20Schematic/schematic.png)

A custom made blind controller running on a [Particle Photon](https://particle.io) microcontroller.

Allows control of two sets of blind motors, and weight sensing (bed occupancy sensor).
